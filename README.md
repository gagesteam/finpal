### Tasks (Issues)
The tasks that we have planned for work, are all listed on the projects page under the current status of the task: 'RAID - Blocked' (tasks blocked/waiting on something/someone else), 'To Do' (planned tasks which have not been worked on yet), 'In Progress' (tasks which have been started and are being worked on currently), 'Verify - Code Review' (tasks which should be completed and are being double checked by another member of the project to ensure stable code), and 'Done' (tasks which are completed, tested, and integrated with the main project code.

### Stories (Milestones)
In agile development, tasks can be tracked through 'stories'. GitHub is capable of this feature through, what they call, Milestones. All of our stores/milestones can be viewed through the Milestones page, which can be found by selecting the `Issues` tab above, and then selecting `Milestones` with the button towards the top right. Otherwise, you can just [click here](https://github.com/haflga/finpal/milestones) to reach the same page. This page can show all of the current overarching tasks, that we have planned and split into smaller tasks to complete. Clicking on any of these milestones can give you a view of the associated work and status.
